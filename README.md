# Fallen Champions
A dungeon crawler game. 
Select a hero with unique abilities and go exploring within a treacherous dungeon packed with monsters, potions, and traps.

# Software Design
## Design Patterns
**MVC**  
Separated the game into three major components: Model, View, and Controller.
With the model being the game logic, view being the UI, and controller mediating between the two.

**Singleton**  
Used to ensure only one instance of TUI, AudioManager, and Game is created.

**Momento**  


**Builder**  


**Factory**  


**Mock Object**  


## UML Diagrams
**Model**  

**View**  

**Controller**  



# What I learned

**Software Development Concepts and Practices**:
* Using major design patterns such as MVC, singleton, momento, builder, factory, and mock object
* Closely following SOLID and OO principles for secure, readable, manageable, and maintainable code
* Defensive Programming Techniques
* Writing multithreaded applications
* Utilizing asynchronous programming for text input
* Using event-driven programming
* Testing and debugging
* Writing descriptive and helpful documentation
* Learned and experienced the software development cycle by:
   * Writing a Software Requirements and Specifications (SRS) document
   * Designing UML diagrams to follow
   * Implementing the designs in code
   * Deploying game as an installable application
  
**Team**:
* Working and communicating effectively within a team
* Leadership and planning skills within a team
* Practicing pair programming with teammates

**Agile Development**:
* Making small, incremental changes via user stories
* Using agile project management tools such as Pivotal Tracker
* Using version control tools such as Git

**External Libraries**:
* Connecting and reading from SQLite for monster data and hero suffixes
* Using JavaFX for GUI
