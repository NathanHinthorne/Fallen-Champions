# Storyline
## Prologue
* The player is introduced to the dungeon by the dungeon keeper
* The dungeon keeper explains the rules of the dungeon
* The game looks as if it's a regular dungeon crawler

## Routes
* There are 2 routes the player can take, the normal route and the hacker route
  * Should the normal route have an ending?
* The normal route is the regular dungeon crawler game, while the hacker route is obtained by collecting and using all parchments scattered throughout the dungeon (1 parchment per dungeon)
* The parchments contain encrypted writings (cheat codes) from previous adventurers (with the first parchment being the easiest to decrypt) 
* The player has the opportunity to enter these cheat codes in one of two places:
  1. in the main menu
  2. in the dungeon (leaning against this option)
* The cheat codes are used to unlock abilities that are not normally available to the player. Refer to parchment enum for more details.
* If the player is greedy or curious about these parchments (which is something to encourage throughout the game) then they will eventually unlock the hacker route

## Final Boss  
### The boss's story and motivation
* The dungeon keeper's duty is to keep the game running as intended with no glitches (he knows he's in a game)
* He views this as "his" game
* Dungeon keeper wants to keep you in the game?
* As you start to collect parchments, he tries to hide the fact that you can use the inscriptions on parchments as cheat codes.
* Collecting parchments makes him view you as a threat, causing him to drop comments here and there, implicitly warning you to stop hacking.
* He gets more and more angry whenever you find a parchment
* He somehow knows that you've collected a parchment i.e. "you didn't find anything suspicious in there, did you?"
* 

### How the boss is revealed
* Once you collect all the pieces of parchment the dungeon keeper reveals himself as the boss
  * He reveals himself only once you collect the last parchment (and use its code) because with this last ability, he now views you as unstoppable
* A good statement might be: "I don't merely hold the keys to this dungeon, I hold the keys to this ENTIRE GAME!"
* 

### Boss Battle
* The boss is supposed to have access to all the game code, so he can do anything he wants
  * At first, the player only has access the cheats unlocked previously by the parchments
  * Eventually, the player has to find out how to gain access to the game code. 
    * The dungeon keeper will be astonished when this happens
    * The player will still be limited to some extent as to what they can do (based on the pretend game code that printed in front of them)
    * This part should be a puzzle of some sort that has a hacking theme to it
* He will (reluctantly?) alter the game code himself to make himself more powerful with cheats in order to beat you.
